### Customer purchase intent
 
Customer purchase intent refers to the likelihood or probability that a customer will make a purchase. It reflects the customer's intention or willingness to buy a product or service, based on various factors such as their needs, wants, preferences, and the perceived value of the product or service.

Customer purchase intent can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as the product's price, quality, features, benefits, reputation, availability, and the customer's previous experience with the brand or similar products. It can also be influenced by external factors such as advertising, promotions, recommendations from friends or family, and market trends.

Understanding customer purchase intent is essential for businesses, as it helps them to target the right customers and create effective marketing strategies. By identifying customers with a high purchase intent, businesses can focus their resources on those customers, offer them personalized deals and promotions, and create a more engaging customer experience.
