Innovation Types:

[Four Types of Innovation overview](https://www.mba.com/business-school-and-careers/why-business-school/four-types-of-innovation)

The “innovator’s dilemma” is the tough choice any company faces when it has to choose between holding onto an existing market by doing the same, yet slightly better (**sustaining innovation**), or capturing new markets by embracing new technologies and adopting new business models (**disruptive innovation**).


[1. Disruptive Innovation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/disruptive-innovation.asp#:~:text=our%20editorial%20policies-,What%20Is%20Disruptive%20Innovation%3F,accessible%20to%20a%20broader%20population.)- 

- Single line Definition: 
		Disruptive innovation significantly alter and improve a product or service in ways that the market did not expect.

- According to my understanding: 
		Frameworks are built and are used only within that company which done innovation but if they publish that to public as white paper it will disrupt the market to develop lot of reference implementations. 

- Examples:
	1. Internet as disruptive technology/innovation opened the opportunity for Google, Amazon, Facebook.
	2. Innovation of Blockchain and development of Bitcoin on Blockchain. Now blockchain is disruptive to Traditional Banking process. The system expects trustworthy process turning to blockchain.
	4. Rocket Launching owned by NASA outsourced to SpaceX.  NASA disrupted the rocket launching market.
	5. Phone, Computer, Rocket.

[2. Breakthrough Innovation](https://ideascale.com/blog/breakthrough-innovation/#:~:text=What%20Is%20Breakthrough%20Innovation%3F,the%20market%20or%20the%20industry.)

- **Single line Definition:**
	
- **According to my understanding:** 
		Breakthrough innovation is an innovation from inside a company that pushes something to the next level. It opens the company to new markets and changes the way customers interact with the market or the industry.		
- **Examples:**
	1. Google published Map-reduce white paper that lead to lot other open source projects in distributed computing for processing large scale data starting from Hadoop, Spark etc.
	2. Raspberry Pi created more opportunity to lot of innovation in IOT sector.
	3. Perhaps the most popular example of this is Netflix. At first, they presented a breakthrough innovation by introducing a subscription model that delivered DVDs to people through the mail. 	But then they disrupted the entire home entertainment industry by introducing streaming services and becoming a content producer themselves. That shut down the Blockbusters and Hollywood Videos of the world and changed how Hollywood produces and sells TV and movies.

**Breakthrough will disrupt:**
Breakthrough innovation is disruptive and changes your organization in many fields, potentially makes entire industries obsolete, as digital photography did to the film industry. As things change, the old paradigm becomes incompatible with the new reality and there occurs a digital paradigm shift.

Breakthrough innovation is the most important concept in innovation because it can be demonstrated virtually all real economic growth or societal progress which is driven by disruptions.

3. Sustaining Innovation:

- **Single line Definition:**
- **According to my understanding:** 
- **Examples:**

A sustaining innovation **improves existing products**. It does not create new markets or value markets, but develops existing ones with better value, allowing companies to compete against each other's sustaining improvements.

Example:

The key difference between radical sustaining technology and disruptive technology is that they are aimed at different audiences. **Sustaining technologies are usually aimed at current customers while disruptive technologies appeal to those who are not presently served in the market**.

**Conclusion:** The “innovator’s dilemma” is the tough choice any company faces when it has to choose between holding onto an existing market by doing the same, yet slightly better (**sustaining innovation**), or capturing new markets by embracing new technologies and adopting new business models (**disruptive innovation**).
