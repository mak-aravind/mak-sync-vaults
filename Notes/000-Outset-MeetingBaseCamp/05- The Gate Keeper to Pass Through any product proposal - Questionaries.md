Why we have to [Plan Product](https://www.productplan.com/learn/what-is-product-planning/)

### The vision will outset the product to the intended mission:

- What is the Product's Vision?

	- Vision statements 
		- are aspiration and communicate concisely where the product hopes to go and what it hopes to achieve in the long term. 
		- **aims to provide value**  First, the product vision needs to be customer-focused. Your objective needs to be to satisfy the genuine needs of your customers and develop a product that they find valuable.
	 - Example:
		 - Product Vision Netflix's: At Netflix, **we want to entertain the world**. Whatever your taste, and no matter where you live, we give you access to best-in-class TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games. Our members control what they want to watch, when they want it, in one simple subscription.	
		- Company Vision Intuit: **We help our customers and communities overcome their most important financial challenges**.
		- Company Vision Apple :  To bringing the best user experience to its customers through its innovative hardware, software, and services.
